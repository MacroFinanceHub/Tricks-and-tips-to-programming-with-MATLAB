%% LOOPS

%Compute the sum 1 through 5 without using sum function, but using a loop:

%Set total to 0
%Set n to 1
%Execute Add n to total (total equals 1) - 1st iteration
%Set n to 2
%Execute Add n to total (total equals 1) - 2nd iteration
%Set n to 3 and so on

%% FOR-LOOPS

%this is in fact done by a for-loop, only implicitly
u = [5 4 8 8 2];
v = [5 5 7 8 8];
w = u -v

%the same with an explicitly loop
for ii = 1_lenght(u)
    w(ii) = u(ii) - v(ii);
end


%% NESTING LOOPS

% implicit loop, see mul.m for explicit loop
A = randi(10,3,4)
P = A.*A

% see mul and asterisks

%% WHILE LOOPS

% good when you are not sure how many iterations you need
% schematically similar to an if-statement
% see possum and approx_sqrt


%% BREAK STATEMENTS

% See BreakExamples, BadBreak, GoodBreak

% There is also a continue statement, but its rarely used

%% LOGICAL INDEXING
