% First question:

a = [1 2 3;4 5 6;7 8 9]*[0 1 0]'

% Second question:

A = [1:4;2:2:9;0 0 2 -1]
s = A(end,3)

% Third question:

x5x2x3 = 34
X_Y = 3456
Hatethishomeworksomuch = 456

% Fourth question:

v = -55:5:55
length(v)

% Fifth question: Operators work on operands.

% Sixth question: Matrix multiplication requires the same inner dimensions
% of operands.

% Seventh question: 

v = 1:2:22
t = v(end)

% Eigth question:

% t = (2:2:8)^2 <- error

% Nineth question:
