% A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome 
% made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Write a 
% function that is called this way: >> n = palin_product(dig,lim);
% The function returns the largest palindrome smaller than lim that is the 
% product of two dig digit numbers. If no such number exists, the function 
% returns 0. (Inspired by Project Euler.)

% input1: dig, the number of digits
