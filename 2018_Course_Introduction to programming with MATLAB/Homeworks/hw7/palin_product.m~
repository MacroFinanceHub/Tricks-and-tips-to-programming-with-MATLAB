% A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome 
% made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Write a 
% function that is called this way: >> n = palin_product(dig,lim);
% The function returns the largest palindrome smaller than lim that is the 
% product of two dig digit numbers. If no such number exists, the function 
% returns 0. (Inspired by Project Euler.)
%
% input1: dig, the number of digits
% input2: lim, the product of the largest two numbers with dig digits 
% output: n, the largest product of two numbers with dig digits that is a 
%           palindrome and smaller than lim
%         n = 0, if such n does not exist  

function [n] = palin_product(dig,lim)
   upperlimit = (10^dig) - 1;                   % define the largest and smallest numbers that have dig digits
   lowerlimit = 10^(dig - 1);
   withinlimits = upperlimit: -1: lowerlimit;   % the sequence of numbers between lower and upper limits
%Future hint:
%to verify a palindrome: 
%will need to use c = num2str(__) 
%and see if it is equal to itself read in reverse by using c(end:-1:1)
